==============

Everything that has a beginning has an end. For 3 years, I've been working on OpenStack to provide a reliable and easy-to-use private cloud.

Along this time, what I had notice is that most people just want a service running on the net, not a whole virtual machine to maintain. Of course, my first choice was [Magnum](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Magnum), but it showed to me too complex to keep up (and too many layers).

Now, it's time to rethink. So, I decided to join forces with my campus IT staff, and build a new cloud - a container cloud -, now using [Container Linux](https://github.com/ctic-sje-ifsc/coreos) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/ctic-sje-ifsc/kubernetes).
